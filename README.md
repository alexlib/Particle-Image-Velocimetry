Particle-Image-Velocimetry
==========================

Image Processing and Image Vector mapping of raw image snapshots using PIV technique

Raw images obtained from PIV technique have been processed 
-noise removed, 
-out-of-plane vectors removed, 
-morphological opening 
-mapping of PIV velocity vectors (after scaling) back onto the image
-- method sub2ind maps maps the vectors onto the raw image

After processing; turbulent eddy length, time and velocity scale can be obtained.
